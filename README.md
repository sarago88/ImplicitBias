# Practice your R skills: Judgments About Implicit Bias

This tutorial will help you sharpen your R and statistical skills by replicating analysis from a 2019 paper on implicit bias from the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.

Start by reading the paper (JESP_paper.pdf).

This tutorial will challenge you to apply the following skills:
- Subsetting data
- Creating new variables
- Creating a correlation matrix
- Conducting and interpreting t-tests and ANOVAs
- Summarizing data
- Creating bar graphs using ggplot2

Instructions:
- You do not need to download any data files
- You have a choice of working with two different tutorial files:
    - ImplicitBias_tutorial.R will guide you through the steps, but provides no code
    - ImplicitBias_tutorial_with_code.R includes some code to get you started, and you will need to fill in the blanks
- You can access the full solution in ImplicitBias_solution.R
- You can download files by either cloning this repository to your computer via RStudio (https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html), or you can simply download all files by clicking the green "Code" button, and selecting "Download ZIP"
